# SHOOTER_PONG
A classic game with a twist.

Move cursor to control your paddle. First to 10 points wins the game - but be careful! Computer also shoots bullets - if your paddle is destroyed, you LOSE. Press p to pause.

NOTE: Since most browsers don't support cross origin resource resource sharing, you need to setup a local webserver (e.g. localhost:8000) in directory of pong.html in order for the game to function in the browser.
